# Azure AI Vision

This repository contains a project where I am learning to use Azure AI Vision's face detection services. The main goal is to explore how Azure AI Vision can be used to detect faces in images, including the ability to identify the use of facial masks.

## Example Usage

In this project, I used the tutorial provided by Microsoft to perform face detection using Vision Studio. Following the steps of the tutorial, I was able to understand how to set up an Azure AI services resource, connect that resource to Vision Studio, and perform face detection on provided images.

## Process

1. **Azure Resource Creation**: I started by creating an Azure AI services resource in my Azure subscription, following the recommended settings.

2. **Connection to Vision Studio**: Next, I connected the Azure AI services resource to Vision Studio to explore the available face detection features.

3. **Face Detection**: Using Vision Studio, I performed face detection on sample images provided in the tutorial, as well as on some of my own images for experimentation.

## Learnings and Insights

During the development of this project, some important learnings were acquired:

- **Azure Resource Configuration**: I learned how to configure Azure AI services resources and how to connect them to tools like Vision Studio.

- **Practical Use of Face Detection**: I understood the practical application of face detection in different contexts, such as identifying customers in stores.

- **Detection Limitations**: I also noted the limitations of face detection, such as the inability to detect partially obscured faces.

## Next Steps

This project served as a valuable introduction to Azure AI Vision and its face detection capabilities. As next steps, I plan to further explore the features offered by Azure AI Vision and conduct additional experiments with different types of images.
